## Introduction

In this lab, I will go through the entire process of vulnerability management, from identifying vulnerabilities to remediating them. By the end of this lab, I gained valuable experience in handling cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before I started,I had basic knowledge of Azure, virtual machines, and cybersecurity concepts.

## Lab Setup

### Creating a Free Azure Account

1. Start by creating a free Azure account to get the platform for our lab activities.

### Setting up the Vulnerability Management Scanner

1. Install OpenVAS from the Azure marketplace. Use a weak pre-set configuration for your virtual machine (VM).
2. SSH into the VM and wait for OpenVAS to deploy.
3. Log into the web app using the provided default credentials and immediately change the password for security purposes.

### Configuring the Vulnerable Client Virtual Machine

1. Create a client virtual machine in the same region and virtual network as OpenVAS.
2. Install outdated versions of software like Firefox, VLC Player, and Adobe Reader to intentionally make it vulnerable.

### Performing Unauthenticated Scans

1. Configure OpenVAS to perform the first unauthenticated scan against the vulnerable VM.
2. Create a new target, host, and task for this process.
3. Analyze the scan results to identify vulnerabilities.

### Preparing for Credentialed Scans

1. Configure settings within the vulnerable VM, such as disabling the Windows Firewall, User Account Control, enabling Remote Registry, and setting a specific Registry Key.
2. Configure OpenVAS for credentialed scans by creating new credentials and cloning the previous target.

### Executing Credentialed Scans

1. Execute the credentialed scan against the vulnerable VM using the newly created credentials.
2. This scan provides a more in-depth analysis of vulnerabilities but may take longer than the unauthenticated scan.

### Remediating Vulnerabilities

1. Identify vulnerabilities from the scan results.
2. Remediate vulnerabilities by uninstalling outdated software on the vulnerable VM and restarting it.

### Verifying Remediations

1. Re-initiate the credentialed scan to verify the effectiveness of remediations.
2. Observe the results to ensure vulnerabilities have been addressed.

This lab provides hands-on experience in vulnerability management. Thank you for joining us, and happy learning!
